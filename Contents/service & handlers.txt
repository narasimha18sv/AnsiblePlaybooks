Ansible’s service module controls services on remote hosts and is useful for these common tasks like Start, 
stop or restart a service on a remote host.

Handlers helps us to make sure this can be done easily. 

service example:

- name: ensure apache2 service is started
  service:
    name: apache2
    state: started   # other optoions here stopped/restarted 
 
if you want to ensure that a service is started on system boot

- name: ensure apache2 service is started and also starts on boot. Generally this willbe in redhat based OS.
  service:
    name: apache2
    state: started
    enabled: true
If these services are needed to be run from root user then we need to "become: yes"

Now how about handlers????

Handlers are independent and idempotent. They may be called at any time after configuration was done in any order.
if any task or generally service restarts need to be done whenever there is a configuration change then we use handlers there. 

example: if we change the default ip address of the apache2 service to run in the conf then we need to use handler to 
restart the service again. 

## Handlers:

Handlers are just like normal tasks in an Ansible playbook but they run only when if the Task contains a “notify” directive. It also indicates that it changed something. Let take a example, it is useful for secondary actions that might be required after running a Task

- hosts: localhost
  tasks:
    - name: Enable Symfony config template from Nginx available sites
      notify: Restart Nginx
  handlers:
    - name: Restart Nginx
      service:
        name: nginx
        state: restarted

Apart from the above examples handlers can be any of the tasks not just service related.
