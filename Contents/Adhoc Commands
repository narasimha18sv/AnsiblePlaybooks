Ansible supports several sources for configuring its behavior, including an ini file named ansible.cfg, environment variables, 
command-line options, playbook keywords, and variables.

Changes can be made and used in a configuration file which will be searched for in the following order:

        ANSIBLE_CONFIG (environment variable if set)
        ansible.cfg (in the current directory)
        ~/.ansible.cfg (in the home directory)
        /etc/ansible/ansible.cfg


Version check:

ansible --version

This command also shows the output of ansible.cfg file location if set

/etc/ansible/hosts -- default inventory file that would be taken by ansible

add 127.0.0.1 to hosts file

$ ansible -m ping all

127.0.0.1 | SUCCESS => {
    "changed": false, 
    "ping": "pong"
}

# to copy a file 
$ ansible -m copy -a "src = /etc/yum.conf dest = /tmp/yum.conf"

# Gather Facts
$ ansible all -m setup
