If you have a large playbook, it may become useful to be able to run only a specific part of it rather than running everything in the playbook. 
Ansible supports a “tags:” attribute for this reason.

tasks:
- yum:
    name:
    - httpd
    - memcached
    state: present
  tags:
  - packages

- template:
    src: templates/src.j2
    dest: /etc/foo.conf
  tags:
  - configuration

if you wanted to just run the “configuration” and “packages” part of a very long playbook, you can use the --tags option on the command line:
$ ansible-playbook example.yml --tags "packages"

if you want to run a playbook without certain tagged tasks, you can use the --skip-tags command-line option:
$ ansible-playbook example.yml --skip-tags "packages"

There is a special always tag that will always run a task, unless specifically skipped (--skip-tags always)

tasks:
- debug:
    msg: "Always runs"
  tags:
  - always

- debug: msg="{{ showmevar }}"
  tags:
    - never
 Another special tag is never, which will prevent a task from running unless a tag is specifically requested.
