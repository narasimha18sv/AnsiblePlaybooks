Ansibleâ€™s template module transfers templated files to remote hosts. It works similarly to the copy module, but with 2 major differences:

    1. template looks for templates in ./templates/ when you supply a relative path for src (instead of ./files/ for copy)
    2. You can use the jinja2 templating language in your files, which will be templated out separately for each remote host

The template module is extremely useful for doing machine-specific configuration based on Ansible variables.

example:

- name: use template files
  template:
      src: example.conf.j2
      dest: /tmp/example.conf
      
example.conf.j2 content:

ip: {{ ansible_enp0s8.ipv4.address }}
inputs: {{ package_name }}

After playbook execution example.conf file will look like

# cat /tmp/example.conf 
ip: 192.168.56.102
inputs: apache2

      
every template configuration file you want that needs to be extended with ".j2" which is jinja2 template style.

jinja2 template style is nothing but how we do access the varibale in the tasks, will be simillarly accessed in the configuration files.
