Blocks allow for logical grouping of tasks and in play error handling. if you want to have multiple tasks to work for single condition it will be clumsy
to add when confition to each of the task. Here blocks will help in doing that easier way.

tasks:
   - name: Install, configure, and start Apache
     block:
       - name: install httpd and memcached
         yum:
           name:
           - httpd
           - memcached
           state: present

       - name: apply the foo config template
         template:
           src: src.j2
           dest: /etc/foo.conf
       - name: start service bar and enable it
         service:
           name: bar
           state: started
           enabled: True
     when: ansible_distribution == 'CentOS'

   - name: Install, configure, and start Apache
     block:
       - name: install httpd and memcached
         yum:
           name:
           - apache2
           - memcached
           state: present
     when: ansible_distribution == 'Ubuntu'


  Sometimes even if there are few errors still we might need to execute the playbooks. at that time add "ignore_errors: yes" below the taskor when conition 
  which will make sure it wont stop execution even that task is failed. 
    - name: Install, configure, and start Apache
     block:
       - name: install httpd and memcached
         yum:
           name:
           - apache2
           - memcached
           state: present
     when: ansible_distribution == 'Ubuntu'
     ignore_errors: yes
