Ansible is a simple open source IT engine which automates application deployment, intra service orchestration, cloud provisioning and many other IT tools. Ansible uses YAML as its coding language which is easily readable for anyone.

Ansible is an agent less configuration management tool which uses SSH/WINRM to connect to the servers which need to be configured. For linux servers it uses ssh protocol and for windows servers it uses WINRM service for establishing connection. 

Letâ€™s have a look at some of the terminology used in ansible:
  Controller Machine: Machine where Ansible is installed
  Inventory: Information regarding servers to be managed
  Playbook: Automation is defined using tasks defined in YAML format
  Task: Procedure to be executed
  Module: Predefined commands executed directly on remote hosts
  Play: Execution of a playbook
  Role: a Predefined way for organizing playbooks
  Handlers: Tasks with unique names that will only be executed if notified by another task
An Ansible controller machine will always be a linux machine. 
Ansible also comes with a UI tool called Ansible tower which helps in managing the hosts.
