Inventory refer to the all the servers on which we want to execute the ansible playbooks. 

Default inventory file that would be taken by ansible will be /etc/ansible/hosts. 

If we dont want to use that and want use your own file with servers use "-i" option with file path. 

$ ansible-playbook -i inventory test.yml

Grouping of servers:

Inventory file can contain all the servers mentioned line by line. apart from that we can group multiple servers like

example:

[web]
hostname1
hostname2

[database]
db1
db2

While writing the playbook you need to mention the same group names mentioned in the inventory file. if the playbook needs to be exceuted on all the servers 'all'
needs to be used 

---
- name: execute playbook
  hosts: all #web/db1 if any specific group servers 
  

Apart from these if there are any specific variables to the server we can specify them in the inventory file. for example like the username and password 
that can be used for executing the playbook on a server. 

[web]
hostname1 ansible_user=user1  ansible_host=10.16.10.13
hostname2 

above example tells if you want to particular values in for a server/host. 
These variables are called host_vars

if you want to provide ansible variables to all the serves in a group then you can mention as below

[web:vars]
ansible_ssh_user=root
ansible_ssh_private_key_file=/root/.ssh/id_rsa #if you have a different private keys you can use this to specify path. 
http_port=443
ntp_server=us.pool.ntp.org

by specifying like above these variables will be applied to all the servers in that group in that inventory file. Even we can specify variables too apart from 
the ansible conenction variables. These are called group_vars.

group_vars and host_vars can be mentioned by creating group_vars file in the roles path. Generally roles path will be /etc/ansible.

create a new folder group_vars and in that create a file with the group name. like above web.yaml is the group vars in that above example. 
we will add all the variables mentioned will be added to the file. 

If it is host specific variables then create host_vars foldeer in /etc/ansible path. create file with hostname along .yml extension. 
add the required variables in that file.
