Linux servers we use SSH keys or password to execute the playbooks but how about windows servers. 

Windows servers use "winrm" module to execute playbooks. But the tasks/modules wont be same for linux and windows. 

For windows each module is different like copy, choclaty or other operations. 

How to connect using winrm ????

To connect to the windows server we definitely need password. 
Check the group_vars/windows.yml file for the additional parameters needed to connect windows serves. 

Once we add them we would be able to connect to the windows servers. 

But winrm runs on http/https with portd 5985/5986. So if you are ina secured enviornment/cloud servers you need to make sure these ports are open to connect
and execute ansible playbooks.
